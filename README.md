Project description
-------

[Xv6](http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2012/xv6.html) is a simple Unix-like teaching operating system developed in 2006 by MIT for its operating system course. Xv6 is inspired by and modeled after the Sixth Edition Unix (aka V6). Xv6 is fairly complete educational operating system while remaining simply and manageable. It has most components in an early Unix system, such as processes, virtual memory, kernel-user separation, interrupt, file system...

The original xv6 is implemented for the x86 architecture. This is an effort to port xv6 to ARM, particularly [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/). The initial porting of xv6 to ARM (QEMU/ARMv6) has been completed by people in the department of [computer science](http://www.cs.fsu.edu/) in [Florida State University](http://www.fsu.edu/).

Debug
-------
1. use QEMU to dump a execution trace
`qemu-system-arm -M versatilepb -m 128 -cpu arm1176  -nographic -singlestep \
		-d exec,cpu,guest_errors -D qemu.log -kernel kernel.elf`

2. insert `show_callstk` in the kernel to dump current call stacks.
